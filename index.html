    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simpego, Zurich, Switzerland</strong> - Data Analyst/Working Student, 2017–2020<br><br>I had the opportunity to contribute significantly to a car insurance startup by designing machine learning-based pricing models that enhanced pricing accuracy and efficiency. I also played a key role in automating static processes, streamlining operations, and boosting productivity. Additionally, my work involved web scraping and migrating the company’s backend to AWS, further supporting the startup's innovative technological advancements.</li>
        <li><strong>ETH Zurich, IWF, Switzerland</strong> - Research Assistant, 2020–2021<br><br>I focused on innovative research and development, introducing machine learning-based solutions to manufacturing technologies. This experience allowed me to gain valuable insights into an industrial setting, which significantly influenced my decision to pursue a doctorate, even though I returned to the field of physics.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Languages & Frameworks</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Proficient:</strong>  Python, Bash, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Weight & Biases, Slurm, Git </li>
        <li><strong>Basic:</strong>  C++, PostgreSQL, R, AWS Glue & S3, Selenium & Beautiful Soup, Tensorflow </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Project 1:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kaechb/gen_model_playground" target="_blank">Gen Model Playground</a> - A versatile template repository for experimenting with generative models like GANs, VAEs, and Normalizing Flows, designed for educational purposes and quick prototyping, with easy integration with Weights & Biases for logging and visualization.</li>
        <li><strong>Project 2:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kaechb/MDMA/tree/Thesis" target="_blank">Thesis</a> - Consolidated all the models used in my thesis into one framework, making it easier to replicate results in my thesis as reproducability is often overlooked in science.</li>
        <li><strong>Project 3:</strong> <a href="https://caloutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Caloutils</a> - A package providing tools for analyzing and processing calorimeter data in high-energy physics, streamlining workflows and improving accuracy in calorimeter-related analyses.</li>
    </ul>
